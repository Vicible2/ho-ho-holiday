## What is it?

To help our fellow lockdown-captives, we had been tasked with the very special assignment to make a mini-game site to grant some fun to them!

Some of the following features were required:
* Consistent theme/look & feel (winter, santa in our case) 
![Santa!](./running-game/assets/santa-claus.png "Santa icon") 

* Have a feature/game per developer, or one very big feature.
![Gamepad](./running-game/assets/joystick.png "gamepad") 
* An overview page that links to all the features
* Try to have optimized images (and copyright free)
* Some use of Google Analytics
* Add some og Tags
* A clear ReadMe (I mean, duh?)



## Our Way of working:

* Start with a Trello
  * Pitch game ideas
  * Pitch themes/colors
  * Divide games and roles
* No personal deadlines but interact in calls during the day
  * Help eachother with screenshares
  * Share code to implement for eachother
  * Share techniques (falling snow, share icons, etc...)
* No technical restrictions
  * Not everyone is forced to use: scss, certain techniques
  * Adapt code for everyone
  * Make everyone feel the most comfortable with their IDE/techniques
* Run over issues & problems together
  * Merge issues
  * Code not working for someone?
